For CVs the additional columns are:
72 - unimportant
73 - unimportant
74 - unimportant
75 - Delta chi^2 (relative to a flat line)
76 - simulated event type (dccv = CV) 
77 - =column 0
78 - lightcurve filename root
79 - Data challenge lightcurve number

For binary star lenses and bound planets they are:
72 - unimportant
73 - Delta chi^2 (relative to a flat line)
74 - unimportant
75 - Delta chi^2 (relative to a single lens fit PSPL or FSPL if necessary)
76 - |
77 - unimportant
78 - simulated event type (ombin = Binary star, omcassan = Bound planet) 
79 - unimportant (I think)
80 - lightcurve filename root
81 - Data challenge lightcurve number

For single lenses they are (***Note for these, the mass of the lens is given by the planet mass column, not the host mass column):
72 - unimportant
73 - number of consecutive W149 data points deviating by >=3 sigma from a flat line
74 - unimportant
75 - Delta chi^2 (relative to a flat line
76-91 - unimportant
92 - simulated event type (dcnormffp = single lens or free-floating planet) 
93 - unimportant (I think)
94 - lightcurve filename root
95 - Data challenge lightcurve number
